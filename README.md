# Sample ETH-BSC bridge

This project demonstrates a basic ETH-BSC bridge use case. It comes with a bunch of simple contracts, scripts for deployment and scripts to interact with the ETH-BSC bridge

To use the bridge:
- Execute the deploy.ts, create your own .env and copypaste the necessary data to .env
- Start the Bridge API, listeningScript.ts
- Try to make a transfer, using transfer_bsc_eth.ts or transfer_eth_bsc.ts
- To get the balance, use getBalance.ts
```
